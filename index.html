				<h2>Southern Praying Mantis</h2>
				<p>Kwong Sai Jook Lum Gee Tong Long Pai (Kwong Sai Province, Bamboo Forest Monastery Praying Mantis Family) is a martial art founded by Monk Sam Dot and passed down directly to Master Gin Foon Mark in an unbroken lineage.</p>
				<p>Southern Praying Mantis places a heavy emphasis on close-range fighting. This system is known for its short power methods, and has aspects of both internal and external techniques.</p>

					<h3>Iron Ox</h3>
					<p>The Iron Ox system can be traced historically to the area of South China where the other branches of Southern Mantis originated and to the same Hakka communities where the art was transmitted</p>

					<h3>Chow Gar</h3>
					
					<pre>
					However, despite similarities, the genealogies of these branches
					are not complete enough to trace them to a single common ancestor.
					The relationship between Chow Gar and Chu Gar can both be traced directly to Lau Shui.
